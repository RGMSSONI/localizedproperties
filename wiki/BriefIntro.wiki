#summary This is a multilanguage property files editor.

= Introduction =

Often as developers use to make our internationalization applications usable by users who speak different languages. Most programming languages allow applications with internationalization properties files where we want to translate the text to display.
After a complicated time keep all the locations in sync, because the latest is our native language.Then we missing some key files, in some poorly translated, and so on.

The goal of the plugin is to provide an editor where we can review and modify all resource files at once and get a glimpse of the texts for all languages.
